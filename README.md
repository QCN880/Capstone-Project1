### Excel Analysis
---
  - #### Data Cleaning in Excel :
     1. Remove Duplicate Entries:Go to the Data tab, select Remove Duplicates, and apply it on the entire Customers Data
     2. Subscription Duration : Add a new column called suscription duration.It was gotten by subtracting subscription end date from the subscription start date.

     4. Saved the clean data and import to SQL for further analysis
      
 - #### Formulas Used 
The formulas used for the analysis and preparation of the projects are :
 - Excel Formulas :
   ``` Excel formula
   Subscription duration = Subscrtiption end date - Subscription start date
   
   Average Subscription Duration = AVERAGE (suscription duration)
   
   Average Revenue Per Customer = SUM (Revenue) /COUNTA ( Customer Id)
   
   Customer Cancellation Rate =(COUNTIF('CustomerData (2)'!G2:G33788,"TRUE")/'CustomerData (2)'!E2:E33788)
   ```
 - #### Questions
